# Discord Wrapped

A simple tool to visualize your Discord chat activity.

To cluster your data, place it in DiscordChat, and then run `python3 cluster.py`. This will generate a `vis_data.json` file that you can use to visualize your data.

To see the visualization, run `python3 app.py` and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.

Here's a [short blog post](https://firstprinciples.pub/#/post/discord-clustering) I wrote about this project.
